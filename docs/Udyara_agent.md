## 2️⃣ Why RAG + LLM Matters

**Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pulls exact policy context from PDFs → LLM only formats & explains.

**Benefit:** Prevents hallucinations and ensures users receive trustable, source-backed information.

**Example Scenario:**  
User asks: *“Am I eligible for a Stand-Up India loan?”*  
- Regular chatbot may guess or give incomplete info.  
- **Udyara** retrieves the official scheme PDF, extracts eligibility criteria, loan range, and next steps — all verifiable and actionable.

## 3️⃣ Agentic Behavior

Even as a **single-agent prototype**, Udyara qualifies as an AI agent because it:

- **Autonomously interprets** policies from raw documents.  
- **Chooses relevant information** for the user’s question.  
- **Provides actionable guidance** (next steps, related questions).  
- **Maintains source transparency**, like a human policy assistant.

⚡ **It’s not just a conversation model — it acts to solve a defined problem.**

## 4️⃣ Future-Proof Multi-Agent Capabilities

Udyara’s architecture can integrate with other agents (e.g., P3AI / Zynd Protocol) to enable:

- Multi-policy eligibility comparisons  
- Real-time government policy updates  
- Cross-scheme recommendations  

Currently single-agent, but **designed for multi-agent, multilingual, or voice-enabled expansion**.

## 5️⃣ Key Takeaways for Judges / Reviewers

✅ **Grounded, explainable answers** → builds user trust in policy guidance.  
✅ **Task-specific automation** → goes beyond generic conversation.  
✅ **Public-good focus** → helps citizens navigate complex government schemes.  
✅ **Prototype-ready** → easy to scale for multi-agent deployment and enhanced features.

> While general-purpose chatbots can answer questions generically, **Udyara is a task-specific agent**: it retrieves actual policy documents, interprets eligibility rules, and provides actionable next steps — all backed by verified sources. It’s designed specifically for **women entrepreneurs navigating government schemes**, not just for general conversation.
